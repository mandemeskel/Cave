TODO:

- further optimization of update(), the various draw() functions and 
raycasting/collision detection 
	-> outline and drawOutline need opt the most

- clean code, rename variables, cull objects/vars/functions and 
standardize( pos or origin? )

- implement rappeling

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------What the game is supposed to be like----------------------

- climbing up and down walls -/ 
	-> further work is needed, its not near perfect

- rappelling from edges

- maps that are actually like caves
	-> deformed walls instead of boxes/straight lines
	-> better and varied map generation

- add water

- add sound( make it creepy but in a pleasant way )

-----------------------------What the game is actually like----------------------
-----------------------------------PASS THE BUG SPRAY----------------------------
BUGS:

- rappeling end and start are very far apart
	-> something is wrong with values passed or when it is drawn

- jumping causes missplaced outline dots

- togglemap() causes a problem with player.isfalling()

- something is wrong with the if statement that determines if the player dies...

- outline dots sometimes poke out


-------------------------------------WARNING!------------------------------------
-------------------------------Warm Fellings Below-------------------------------
DONE:

- fix movement and falling bounds
	-> cant fall through one box wide spaces -/
	-> jumping can get you stuck in cieling -/
	
- seprate player code from game.js, creater player.js -/

- implement bigger maps -/

- implement falling player -/

- player pauses before falling -/
	-> player was not been drawn during fall, player.fall needs to set player.draw to true

- fall rate is summed fall after fall, player.ti = undefined? -/
	-> yep player.ti needs to be set to undefined and player.vy to zero
	
- add movement to centered view and gravity -/
	-> new method of handeling player movement instead of jamming everything in update -/
	
- merged dot and cone objects into player object -/

- Make dot in to a stick figure with a helment and movement animations 
	-> jsbin it( http://jsbin.com/OGeJikI/5/edit ) -/

- Create and implement climbing, rippeling and other cave exploration methods -/

- Randomly generate cave, with all the cave anemities including, entrances 
and exists -/

- isfalling cast ray from edge of player, dot, both edges -/
	-> might need to tweak this for jumping though, you can get stuck on 
	the edges of the map
	-> or we can keep it and call it climbing
	
- add health system -/

- add distance ray travelled before it collided as Ray.far on collision -/

- make the player spwan in an empty box, or make the player spwan empty -/

- add entrance to cave where highscores/current level ends and 
new level are generated -/

- center player and move objects instead of player -/

- fix drawOutline bugs ( draw_window and draw_end ) -/

- fix castrange ( range of indexs of map[][] to cyle through and ray cast ) -/

- cant go to next level, something is wrong with onclick function
	-> need to offset dot position -/
